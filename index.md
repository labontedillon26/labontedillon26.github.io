### Welcome

My name is Dillon Labonte and I am a senior at Southern New Hampshire University. I am majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics while also being a member of the men's cross country team. I was the recipient of the Elite 24 and the Elite 90 awards (highest GPA at conference championships, and at national championships) this past fall. I am the lead STEM peer educator (tutor) at my university's learning center as well as the math major ambassador. I have found a love for electrical engineering throughout my undergrad and plan on pursuing a career in this field. I was a hardware engineering intern at Hubbell Inc. in the summer of 2025 and am eager to start my professional career!

### Sample Work Products

<a href="https://labontedillon26.github.io/SiteFiles/EG490_Final_Paper.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Final Internship Paper:</u></a> <br/>
In the summer of 2025, I interned as a hardware engineering intern at Hubbell Inc. in Portsmouth, NH. Through this internship, I contributed to a pilot EV charger program, focused on embedded system development and hardware integration. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of my work throughout the summer, as well as refelections on the experience and goals for the future.

<a href="https://labontedillon26.github.io/SiteFiles/AnalogElectronicsPortfolio.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Analog Electronics Portfolio:</u></a> <br/>
During the spring of 2025, I took an analog electronics course with a heavy design focus. Content included op-amps, semiconductors, diodes, MOSFETs, BJTs, and single transistor amplifiers. This document provides a compilation of the projects that I completed throughout the semester in the following order:

<ol>
  <li>Homework 1 - Temperature Sensor Interface</li>
  <li>Homework 2 - PWM Generator</li>
  <li>Homework 3 - AM Demodulator</li>
  <li>Homework 4 - Voltage Regulator</li>
  <li>Homework 5 - Variable Gain Amplifier</li>
  <li>Lab Final Project</li>
</ol>

<a href="https://labontedillon26.github.io/MAT300/Analytics_Report.html" target="_blank"><u>Regression Analysis Analytics Report:</u></a> <br/> 
In the fall of 2024 I completed a report where I used linear regression to model day ahead pricing for electricity. This was a final project for a regression analysis course as part of my mathematics major, and has direct applications in the field of data science and electrical engineering. 

<a href="https://labontedillon26.github.io/MAT434StatisticalLearning/FinalProjectFiles/FinalProjectAnalyticsReport.html" target="_blank"><u>Statistical Learning and Classification Analytics Report:</u></a> <br/> 
This report was a final project for a statistical learning and classification course. The focus of this project was on a LiDAR dataframe and using machine learning techniques to predict the environment that the LiDAR module was in at the time of the scan. This is important for robot sensing and navigation, especially as autonomous cars become more prominent. The engineering focus of this project also begs the question, where else can data science and machine learning improve our technologies?

<a href="https://labontedillon26.github.io/SiteFiles/EE201_Project2.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Signals and Systems Fourier Series Project:</u></a> <br/>
I completed the project as part of a signals and systems course in my sophomore year. This course focuses on the Fourier series, where I derived the complex coefficients analytically as a function of duty cycle. The project walks through Fourier series representations of square waves with varying duty cycles, harmonic magnitudes and phases for each duty cycle, and explores relations between DC components and harmonics as a function of duty cycle. This project was an introduction to Fourier series and transforms, a vital tool used in many fields of electrical engineering.
