### Welcome

My name is Dillon Labonte and I am a junior at Southern New Hampshire University. I am majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics while also being a member of the men's cross country team. I was the recipient of the Elite 24 and the Elite 90 awards (highest GPA at conference championships, and at national championships) this past fall. I am the lead STEM peer educator (tutor) at my university's learning center as well as the math major ambassador. I have found a love for electrical engineering throughout my undergrad and plan on pursuing a career in this field. I will be interning as a hardware engineer in the summer of 2025, so I am excited to get some relevant experience under my belt!

### Sample Work Products

I recently completed a report where I used linear regression to model day ahead pricing for electricity. This was a final project for a regression analysis course as part of my mathematics major, and has direct applications in the field of data science and electrical engineering.
